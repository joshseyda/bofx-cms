### 1993

Our personal experience during the past nineteen months within this closed system has been extremely satisfying. Living as an integral component in our small world, both responsible for maintaining it and benefiting from its support, has been as rewarding as it has been challenging. It has changed our perspectives on the role of humans in all closed systems, whether they be artificial systems like Biosphere 2 or natural closed systems like Biosphere 1, our Earth’s biosphere. We participate in a partnership with our biosphere to enhance its well-being by using our own resources, as well as by calling on an extensive network of scientists and engineers on the outside and employing technologies designed to assist in creating desired environmental conditions. There is a new harmony in this effort because our daily experience confirms the fact that we rely on the life systems for survival, and at the same time, the ecological systems depend on our efforts to maximize production and sustain overall health. In a small closed ecological system the equation ‘our biosphere’s health equals our health’ becomes dramatically evident.

Biosphere 2 Experiments

### Biosphere(X) is an effort & process...

that seeks to build upon ground work laid before by people of this culture (henceforth be referred to as Taker culture, or t-culture), that if you are reading this mission statement, you most likely have been born and been raised in. We first acknowledge that our experience with the physical world is but one of a spectrum of human experiences possible, and that this realization might not be unique, but is a privilege that we, as benefactors of this current culture, can ponder a fuller spectrum of experience without the threat of our own existences being called into question.

...that will not retrace the steps of previous “Biosphere” projects. It is clear that ecologies are complex, and a seemingly insignificant local phenomenon can have huge global ramifications. We acknowledge previous insights to this effect, whether it be from scientists from Biosphere 2, or many stories and worldviews of peoples from all over the world. It is due to this recognition that we seek not to prove or disprove theories of Spaceship Earth, but starting from the premise that this is fact, strive to innovate in the realm of cultural values that can revitalize Biosphere 1.

... that seeks not to establish a viable physical ecosystem from within physical impermeable boundaries, but to establish a framework that can maintain its integrity from within Biosphere 1. We recognize that human beings are not separate from the ecosystems that we have been taught to exploit and alienate within this t-culture. With that premise, b(x) is focused on both physical development of technology and techniques that can strengthen itself within Biosphere 1, cultural/spiritual exploration, and mental/social cultivation in order to thrive within and transcend the reality that a globalt-culture is constantly actualizing.

...to synthesize the contradiction that the worlds we work towards is one where b(x) is no longer necessary or relevant.

Our activities include, but are not limited to, procurement of land, reforestation and rewilding of land through perma-culture practices, food production through perma-culture and controlled growing methods such as hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics. Ensuring nutrient cycles are completed in house. Leveraging automation technologies to augment all above mentioned goals. Procurement and storage of energy. Financial due diligence.

### Frameworks

Biosphere(x) draws inspiration from many different avenues, including but not limited to permaculture, the open source community, and indigenous cultures. The name Biosphere(x) itself was inspired from an excerpt that the members of the Biosphere 2 experiments have publicized, which is quoted on our about page.

Biosphere 2 is an ongoing experiment in a closed system for the exploration of space. The crew members of the 1993 experiment were held within physical impermeable boundaries to see how long they can sustain themselves without any physical external input to simulate living on other planets. This experiment lasted less than two years and crew members were able to survive in this closed-system environment by growing their own food, producing compost, and recycling their waste for nutrients and water. The endeavour was unable to fulfill its 2 year time requirement due to a combination of material constraints and more importantly, social breakdowns. We take this as evidence to the immense irreducibility of the biosphere and complex social dynamics that will take more than the scientific method to reconcile.

Our goals extend beyond the physical “sustainability” of a system built within the context of a Life Cycle Analysis. Biosphere(x) is an effort and process to relearn, research, and implement techniques of permanent cultures, not within impermeable boundaries, not on other planets, but within our biosphere, Biosphere 1, the Earth. This is why b(x) is not a part of the lineage of the ongoing experiments like Biosphere 2 or Bios-3, but an effort and a process, seeking out the variable inputs “x,” to create a permanent culture that is focused on the physical development of technology and techniques that can strengthen itself within Biosphere 1, cultural/spiritual exploration, and mental/social cultivation in order to thrive and transcend the reality that the current dominant culture (which is extremely short-sighted) is constantly actualizing.

Some of the frameworks that have shaped our common visions:

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
